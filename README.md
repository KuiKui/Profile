### Profile

I'm a developer since 1999, interested by :

* software quality : VCSs, code review, testing, continuous integration,
* productivity : agile methods, lean management,
* user centric design,

I've been working on a great diversity of projects : I started off by developing Playstation and Game Boy Advance video games for Disney Interactive, then I moved on to extranet for big companies (Renault Trucks, Bayer, Europcar) and online shopping site (LDLC.com, Homair.com). Lately, after working for a long time on medical softwares and their REST API at PMSIpilot, I was hired by a web agency in order to initiate a turn towards agile methods.
