### Profile

I'm a developer since 1999, interested by :

* software quality : VCSs, code review, testing, continuous integration,
* productivity : agile methods, lean management, pragmatic approaches,
* user centric design.

I've been working on a great diversity of projects : I started off by developing Playstation and Game Boy Advance video games for Disney Interactive, then I moved on to extranet for big companies (Renault Trucks, Bayer, Europcar) and online shopping site (LDLC.com, Homair.com). Then, after working for a long time on medical softwares and their [REST API](http://pmsipilot.github.io/API/documentation.html) at PMSIpilot, I was hired by a web agency in order to initiate a turn towards agile methods.

Lately I have been closely taking part in the implementation of the second screen package for the M6 Group channels and I helped a french startup to raise 1M€ in funding by creating a scalable platform architecture.

Then after almost 2 years working with an awesome R&D team on a BtoB marketplace generic system for too greedy investors (which have raise a lot of money with the solution), I've start to help a fresh startup with more honest vision maintaining and developing their multiplatorm service for driving schools (desktops, smartphones and tabs).

I now lead a fantastic R&D team creating a brand new EDMS (Electronic Document Management System) while enjoying the benefits of full-remote work.
